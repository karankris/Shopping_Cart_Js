# Shopping_Cart and Admin form control using JavaScript
   Developed and implemented a JavaScript-based admin form and shopping cart with validation and local storage, enabling users to manage products and add items to their cart.

## Core Features
- **Admin page** is used by the product owners, so admin can add product details like name, price, stockcount, description of that product and picture of the product can be uploaded in this system.
-  **Cart page** is where the End-user can see the products and the details which is set by the admin and user can add their products in the cart untill the maxstock count and the amount of the product is been displayed.
-  **Bill page** is where the image, cost of the single piece and total amount to be payed is displayed as soon as the customer clicks the Place order button a alert message is shown as **"Your order had been placed successfully"**.
